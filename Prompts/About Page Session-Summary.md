## Key Decisions Made This Session

### Design Decisions:
1. **Footer Structure is Canonical** - This exact structure must be used on all pages going forward
2. **Credential Badges** - Two-row grid layout (4 columns), smaller stylized boxes with centered content
3. **Four Core Values** - Reduced from 5 to 4 values with updated copy
4. **Bottom Tray Tagline** - "Rebuilding the Bridge Between Education and Work"

### Content Decisions:
1. Removed "For Employers" from navigation
2. Added "Blog" to navigation
3. Footer "Company" section: About, Contact, Blog only
4. Footer "Resources" section: Log In, Schedule a Demo only
5. Removed "EFFAPay Platform" from footer Solutions

### Job Ready Page Planning:
1. Simplify to: Hero + Bottom Tray + Footer only
2. Three CTA buttons in hero (Explore, Spotify, Apple)
3. Remove all middle content sections
4. Use consistent footer structure

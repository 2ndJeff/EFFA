# EFFA Website Project - Next Session Prompt

Hi Claude! I'm continuing work on the EFFA website redesign project. I've completed the About page and need your help revising the Job Ready Podcast page.

## Context Files to Review
Please start by reading these files I've uploaded:
1. **EFFA-Design-System-Context_v3.md** - Complete design system and standards (PLEASE READ THIS FIRST)
2. **Previous Job Ready Podcast page HTML** - The current version we're revising
3. **effalogo.png** - Logo file for navigation and footer

## Project Status
✅ **Completed Pages:**
- Homepage (Employer-focused)
- Universities Page (Blue gradient theme)
- About Page (Just completed - dark hero with 7 sections)

🔄 **Current Task:** Revise the Job Ready Podcast page

## Job Ready Podcast Page Revision Requirements

### PRESERVE from Current Version:
1. **Hero image** - Keep the same hero background image
2. **Hero title** - Keep the same title text
3. **Hero copy** - Keep the same body copy/description
4. **Job Ready logo reference** - Keep the podcast logo image in hero

### REMOVE from Current Version:
- All content sections below the hero
- Everything between the hero and footer (except the new tagline section)

### ADD to New Version:

#### 1. Three Hero CTA Buttons (Replace current two buttons)
All three buttons should be styled consistently and placed in the hero section:

**Button 1: Explore Job Ready (Primary style)**
- Text: "Explore Job Ready"
- Link: https://jobreadypodcast.com
- Style: Primary orange button (#F7931E)

**Button 2: Listen on Spotify (Secondary style)**
- Text: "Listen on Spotify"
- Link: https://open.spotify.com/show/0Mm2SP7oievqq3hZc4O3Iw
- Style: Secondary button (outline style)

**Button 3: Listen on Apple (Secondary style)**
- Text: "Listen on Apple"
- Link: https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/job-ready/id1726097931
- Style: Secondary button (outline style)

**Button Layout:**
- Desktop: Display all three buttons side-by-side in a row
- Mobile: Stack vertically, full width

#### 2. Bottom Tray Tagline Section
Immediately after the hero, add the bottom tray tagline section (before footer).

**Tagline TBD:** We'll determine the specific tagline together. Some options to consider:
- "Bridging the gap / Between education and employment"
- "Real conversations / Real solutions"
- "Where learning meets earning"
- Or suggest alternatives based on the Job Ready content

#### 3. Updated Footer
Use the EXACT canonical footer structure from the About page:
- **Solutions:** For Employers, For Universities
- **Company:** About, Contact, Blog
- **Resources:** Log In, Schedule a Demo

**CRITICAL:** Do not deviate from this footer structure. It must match exactly.

## Design System Reminders
1. Use the standard EFFA navigation with Blog link (no "For Employers")
2. Apply consistent typography (Inter font family)
3. Maintain orange accent color (#F7931E) for primary actions
4. Keep dark gradient backgrounds where appropriate
5. Ensure mobile responsiveness at 768px breakpoint
6. Footer must match canonical structure EXACTLY

## Deliverables Requested
1. Preview of the revised Job Ready Podcast page (so we can review together)
2. After approval, create a downloadable folder with:
   - HTML file
   - Logo image (effalogo.png)
   - Job Ready logo image (if needed separately)
   - README file for the folder

## Process
1. First, show me the updated page as an artifact/preview
2. We'll review and refine the tagline and any other elements together
3. Once approved, create the final downloadable package

## Important Notes
- I want to see a preview first before creating the downloadable files
- We'll collaborate on the tagline text
- The footer structure is critical - use EXACTLY as documented in the design system
- Keep the page simple and focused - hero + tagline + footer only

Ready to proceed when you are! Please start by reviewing the design system context document and confirming you understand the requirements.

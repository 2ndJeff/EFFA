# EFFA About Page Redesign - Prompt for Next Session

Hi Claude! I'm continuing the EFFA website redesign project. I've attached:

1. **EFFA-Design-System-Context_v2.md** - The complete design system we've established (PLEASE READ THIS FIRST)
2. **Final_About_Page.html** - The current About page that needs updating
3. **universities-updated.html** - Reference for the latest design patterns we implemented

## What I Need:

Please update the About Page to match the design standards we established for the Homepage and Universities pages, including:

### Required Updates:

1. **Navigation:**
   - Remove "For Employers" link
   - Add "Blog" link before Login/Schedule Demo
   - Order: Home | For Universities | About | Contact | Blog | Log In | Schedule a Demo

2. **Design Elements:**
   - Section capsules/tags above major headings (NOT in hero)
   - Enhanced CTA sections with icon boxes + supporting text (side-by-side on desktop, stacked on mobile)
   - Updated footer with logo centered above 3-column layout (Solutions | Company | Resources)

3. **Bottom Tray Tagline Section:**
   - Add a tagline section before the footer (similar to "Free to use. Built for results." on homepage and "3.25% fee. 100% alignment." on Universities page)
   - We'll determine the specific copy together

4. **Preserve:**
   - Dark hero with orange accents (About page color scheme)
   - Overall About page structure and team member content
   - Mission and values messaging

5. **Apply Consistent Patterns:**
   - Typography standards (Inter font, proper sizing)
   - Responsive breakpoints
   - Hover effects and interactions
   - Overall spacing and layout conventions from design system

## Process:

1. Review the design system context document thoroughly
2. Show me a preview of the updated About page as an artifact so we can review and refine it together
3. Once approved, create a downloadable folder with the HTML + logo image

## Important Notes:

- I want to see the mockup in a preview window first before creating the downloadable file
- We'll work together on any refinements needed
- The About page should feel cohesive with the Homepage and Universities pages while maintaining its unique purpose

Ready to proceed when you are!

4. **All images and icons will display perfectly!**

### **For Website Deployment:**
1. Upload the **entire folder** to your web server
2. Keep the structure: `universities.html` and `images/` folder together
3. The relative paths will work on any server
4. No changes needed - it's ready to go!

## Design Specifications

- **Color Palette:** Blue gradient (#4A78BC to #7EBBE6)
- **Hero Icons:** 160x160px SVG with 240px frames
- **Target Audience:** Universities and learning providers
- **Font:** Inter (loaded from Google Fonts)
- **Responsive:** Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile

## Technical Details

- **File Encoding:** UTF-8 (all special characters properly encoded)
- **Image Format:** PNG (logos)
- **Graphics:** Inline SVG (hero icons)
- **CSS:** Embedded in HTML (no external stylesheet needed)
- **JavaScript:** None required
- **Dependencies:** None (except Google Fonts)

## Troubleshooting

**If logos don't display:**
- ✅ Verify the `images` folder is in the same location as `universities.html`
- ✅ Check that `effalogo.png` is inside the `images` folder
- ✅ Make sure you're opening `universities.html` (not just moving it elsewhere)

**If emojis don't display:**
- ✅ Make sure your browser supports UTF-8 encoding (all modern browsers do)
- ✅ The file is already properly encoded, so this should work everywhere

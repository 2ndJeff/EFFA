## How to Use

1. **Extract the zip file** to your desired location
2. **Keep the folder structure intact**:
   ```
   about-page-package/
   ├── about.html
   └── images/
       ├── team/
       ├── advisory/
       └── logos/
   ```
3. **Open `about.html` in your browser** - all images will load correctly!

## For Website Deployment

When you're ready to deploy to your website:

1. Upload the entire `images` folder to your web server
2. Upload `about.html` to your web server
3. Make sure the folder structure stays the same
4. All image paths are relative, so they'll work on any server!
